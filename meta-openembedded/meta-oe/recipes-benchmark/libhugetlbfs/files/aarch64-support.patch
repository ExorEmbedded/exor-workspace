From 52b8430eb4f03e35721f29862de33041fe9c9768 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Steve Capper <steve.capper@linaro.org>

Subject: [PATCH] Aarch64 support.

This patch adds support for Aarch64.

As with ARMv7, We do not add the xBT/xBDT style linker scripts as
these have been deprecated in favour of adjusting the page sizes
via command line parameter to ld.
